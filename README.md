Doc-Ocean was a startup launched in 2015 with an aim of uberising health care, the idea was to connect patients to the nearby health care professionals (Doctor, Nurses) and avail of the services in the comfort of home.

Doctor app Android is basically a front-facing app for health care professional where they can see the request coming from patients, their address details, and service needs, they can accept and reject the request accordingly.

Unfortunately we shutdown the startup in the 6-month span of time because of a lack of financial backup while we needed many government approvals to run the business for healthcare startups.
 
This backend was used to support Android app for health care professionals and patients
